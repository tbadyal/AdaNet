  -- Find the first occurrence of WC in WCS.

  -- The concept of one static locale per category is not very well
  --   thought out.  Many applications will need to process its data using
  --   information from several different locales.  Another application is
  --   the implementation of the internationalization handling in the
  --   upcoming ISO C++ standard library.  To support this another set of
  --   the functions using locale data exist which have an additional
  --   argument.
  --   Attention: all these functions are *not* standardized in any form.
  --   This is a proof-of-concept implementation.   

  -- Structure for reentrant locale using functions.  This is an
  --   (almost) opaque type for the user level programs.   

  -- Special versions of the functions above which take the locale to
  --   use as an additional parameter.

  -- Similar to `wcsftime' but takes the information from

  -- The X/Open standard demands that most of the functions defined in

  --   because some X/Open members wrote their implementation before the
  --   ISO C standard was published and introduced the better solution.
  --   We have to provide these definitions for compliance reasons but we
  --   do this nonsense only if really necessary.   

  -- Define some macros helping to catch buffer overflows.   
  -- Undefine all __need_* constants in case we are included to get those
  --   constants but the whole file was already read.
